# Writing a README
You can add additional documentation to ScholarSphere work pages by including a README file in your deposit. ScholarSphere accepts plain text (README.txt) and markdown (README.md) README files. After uploading the file, you may need to refresh the page for the contents of the README to appear.

## README template

The template below can be copy-and-pasted into a text file, preferably named `README.md` or `README.txt`, and expanded as needed. Text that appears in comment tags (`<!-- like this --->`) is meant as guidance for README authors and should *not* be included in the final version. It is best to use a plain text editor such as TextEdit (Mac), Notepad (Windows), [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [Atom](https://atom.io/), or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

The template uses Markdown formatting. You can read more about markdown [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/). It is based on Cornell's excellent [Guide to "Readme" Style Metadata](https://data.research.cornell.edu/content/readme).

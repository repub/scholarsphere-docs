# Depositing Datasets on ScholarSphere


ScholarSphere supports Penn Stateâ€™s commitment to open access and open science. Researchers at Penn State are encouraged to use ScholarSphere to satisfy data availability requirements (e.g., F.A.I.R) from funding agencies and publishers. However, there are some limits on what can be deposited on SchoalrSphere. 

Information with a Sensitive Information Classification of Moderate (Level 2) or higher according to [Penn State Policy AD95 Information Assurance and IT Security](https://policy.psu.edu/policies/ad95) is not permitted in ScholarSphere. Examples of sensitive information that should not be deposited include: Social Security Numbers (SSNs), passport numbers, biometric data (including fingerprints, retina/facial images, and human DNA profile), birth dates, protected health information, and locations of endangered plants and animals or protected archaeological sites.

There are also some size constraints. Deposits larger than 100 GB in size require approval from repository managers in Penn State Libraries.

Please refer to [ScholarSphere's Content & Deposit Policy](https://scholarsphere.psu.edu/policies) for more complete information.

## Metadata Recommendations

## Step-by-Step


To deposit a dataset on ScholarSphere, follow these steps:

- Start from the ScholarSphere homepage: https://scholarsphere.psu.edu
- Make sure you are logged-in with your Penn State Access Account. Click the "Login" button in the top-right corner of the page to log in.
- From the menu in the top-right corner (where your name appears), select the "Create New Work" option.
- The "New Work Form" is divided into four sections. The first section is for basic metadata. Here, you'll enter the title, work type, abstract, publication date, and other descriptive information for the dataset. For the work type, select "Dataset." For the optional metadata, you might add keywords and a geographic area (i.e., "State College, PA"), however many of the fields are not relevant.
- Click "Save and Continue" to proceed to the Contributors section. 
- In the Contributors section, you can add all the authors for the article ("creators"). You can search for authors using their PSU email, ORCID, or just by entering their name. 
- In the Files section, you can upload your data files and the README
- On the final section, you can review and publish the deposit. You should review the information you've entered and select a license. For data, we recommend the Creative Commons Public Domain Designation ("CC0 1.0 Universal"). You can read the license here: https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/
- You should select the "Public" access setting.
- Indicate that you agree to the depositor's agreement and click "publish" to complete the deposit. 

Following deposit, you may choose to change the "work settings":

- For datasets, we recommend creating a DOI to use for citations.
- You may want to add additional users as "editors" for the work.

# Work Deposit Overview

## First Steps

To deposit a new work to ScholarSphere, you must be logged-in with your Penn State Access account. On the home page, click "Login" in to the top right corner of the page. (If you don't see "Login", and you should your name instead, you are already logged-in).

To start the deposit process, click the menu in the top-right corner, where your name appears, and click "Create New Work".

The new work form is divided into four sections:

- __Work Details__: for entering basic metadata for the work, such as title, work type, and  description
- __Contributors__: for setting author/creator information for the work.
- __Files__: for uploading work files
- __Review and Publish__: for reviewing, setting a license, and finalizing the deposit.

At any point in the process, you can click the "Save as Draft & Exit" to save your progress. Your work will be saved as an unpublished draft. The following sections describe each part of the new work form.

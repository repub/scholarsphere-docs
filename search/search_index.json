For more, see ScholarSphere\u2019s Content and Deposit Policy . Can I deposit my scholarly article in ScholarSphere? Whether you can deposit your scholarly article and which version you can deposit depend on the agreement you signed with your publisher prior to publication. The Sherpa Romeo database is a good starting point for figuring out your rights to deposit your article. You can search by journal or publisher name and see a summary of the journal's default rules related to \"self-archiving\" (the author's posting of the article online). Sherpa Romeo also provides links to the publisher's webpages about self-archiving, so you can double-check the summary to ensure it is up-to-date. If you have a copy of your publishing contract, it's also good to look at that. Your contract sets a minimum for what you can do. Many publishers have set policies giving authors additional rights to self-archive their articles. When looking at Sherpa Romeo, agreements, and publisher policies, pay close attention to two distinctions: the article version in question and the archiving or deposit location being described. Your rights to self-archive your work often vary depending on both of these. Timing is also important. For example, you might be allowed to post a post-print on your personal website from the time of acceptance but not be allowed to post a post-print on an institutional repository until 12 months after publication. For-profit article sharing sites, such as ResearchGate or Academia.edu, may be subject to longer embargoes or banned entirely. To modify the default terms of your publishing agreement before signing it, consider using an author's addendum . With questions, please contact the Office of Scholarly Communications and Copyright . Can I get a DOI (Digital Object Identifier) for my deposited work? Yes, you can assign a new DOI to your deposited work through the \u2018Work Settings\u201d page. You cannot assign a DOI to a draft work. How can I update or remove my work? In ScholarSphere, your work exists as a series of \u201cversions\u201d. You may update and delete the draft version of the work. Once a version is published, it cannot be modified or deleted . You can, however, create a new version that supersedes the previous version.

Preservation: Our main focus is to preserve your scholarly work and make it accessible for the long term. Files deposited into ScholarSphere undergo audits and other digital preservation checks. This helps ensure that your scholarship will be available for generations to come. Dropbox and Box, on the other hand, are primarily file-sharing and file-storage services, rather than digital repository services implementing digital preservation best practices. Sharing scholarship for public access: ScholarSphere collects scholarly and scientific research outputs primarily for public access to them, largely in accordance with Open Access principles and in compliance with funding agency data management planning requirements.

ScholarSphere Collections are well-suited to this purpose as they allow related works to be ordered, contextualized, and presented together. Instructions and recommendations for creating collections of student work on ScholarSphere are provided here. What to deposit on ScholarSphere? ScholarSphere is Penn State\u2019s institutional repository for research data and publications, maintained by the University Libraries. Its primary role is to help members of the Penn State community share their research publicly. Students are encouraged to deposit products of their research if: The work was supervised by Penn State faculty. The work is the student\u2019s (see IPG02 ) and they are willing to share it publicly. (Students are not encouraged to deposit work with the \u201cPenn State\u201d-only visibility setting. The work meets requirements defined in ScholarSphere\u2019s deposit policy . Anyone with a valid PSU account can deposit work to ScholarSphere, however repository managers may follow-up with additional questions and potentially remove deposits that do not meet these requirements. Creating Collections The general process for creating collections is, hopefully, fairly straight-forward. From the menu in the top-right corner of the ScholarSphere homepage, logged-in users can create collections using the \"Create New Collection\" form. Collections require a title and a description; additional metadata fields are recommended, especially publication date, keywords, and creators. The form for creating and editing collections includes a tab called \"works\" where you can search for works to add to the collection. It's important to note that you must have edit access for works to add them to a collection -- you must be listed as an \"editor\" on the work's \"Settings\" page. This means that if students have deposited their own works (i.e., following the \"self-deposit\" approach outlined below), they need to add you (the collection creator) as an editor for the work before it can be included in the collection. This is not necessary using the \"proxy deposit\" approach because the collection and constituent works are created by the same person. Two Approaches: Self-Deposit or Proxy Deposit There are two common approaches for creating collections of student work - they differ in who creates the works that will comprise the collection. In the self-deposit scenario, students deposit their own works (giving the collection creator edit access in the process). Alternatively, in the proxy deposit scenario, the collection creator deposits work on behalf of the students. In both scenarios, the collection creator adds work to the collection once the works are created. The main advantage of the self-deposit approach is that it requires less work for the collection creator. In addition, when students deposit their own work, they agree to ScholarSphere's deposit agreement during the upload process--in the proxy deposit scenario, on the other hand, the collection creator must obtain permissions from students to upload works on their behalf (see below). The main advantage of the proxy deposit approach is that it tends to result in higher quality collections as librarians and instructors are more like to perform deposits in a complete and consistent manner. It also simplifies the permissions problem described above: students will not need to manually add the collection creator as an editor of their submissions. If past projects are any guide, the proxy deposit approach seems to be the preferred. This is likely because instructors and librarians prefer to shoulder the burden of many ScholarSphere submissions rather than guide students through that process or trust them to complete it correctly. Obtaining Permission from Students If collection creators prefer to deposit works on students' behalf, then they will need to obtain permissions from the students. A recommended approach is to include this permission, with a link to the deposit agreement, in a form used to collect work submissions from students (examples are available upon request). For example: \"I hereby approve my project files to be uploaded to Scholarsphere under the conditions above and accept the terms of the ScholarSphere deposit agreement (https://scholarsphere.psu.edu/agreement).

Sherpa Romeo also provides links to the publisher's webpages about self-archiving, so you can double-check the summary to ensure it is up-to-date. If you have a copy of your publishing contract, it's also good to look at that. Your contract sets a minimum for what you can do. Many publishers have set policies giving authors additional rights to self-archive their articles. When looking at Sherpa Romeo, agreements, and publisher policies, pay close attention to two distinctions: the article version in question and the archiving or deposit location being described. Your rights to self-archive your work often vary depending on both of these. Timing is also important. For example, you might be allowed to post a post-print on your personal website from the time of acceptance but not be allowed to post a post-print on an institutional repository until 12 months after publication. For-profit article sharing sites, such as ResearchGate or Academia.edu, may be subject to longer embargoes or banned entirely. To modify the default terms of your publishing agreement before signing it, consider using an author's addendum.

Click the \"Login\" button in the top-right corner of the page to log in. From the menu in the top-right corner (where your name appears), select the \"Create New Work\" option. The \"New Work Form\" is divided into four sections. The first section is for basic metadata. Here, you'll enter the title, abstract (\"description\"), keywords, publication date, the journal name (\"Publisher\"), and the publisher's DOI (if available). Click \"Save and Continue\" to proceed to the Contributors section. In the Contributors section, you can add all the authors for the article (\"creators\"). You can search for authors using their PSU email, ORCID, or just by entering their name. In the Files section, you can upload your article file. The PDF is preferred. On the final section, you can review and publish the deposit. You should review the information you've entered and select a license. The license you can select will depend on your agreement with the publisher but \"All rights reserved\" is often a safe default. This FAQ entry has additional information: https://psu.libanswers.com/faq/279046 You should select the \"Public\" access setting. Indicate that you agree to the depositor's agreement and click \"publish\" to complete the deposit. If you need to set an embargo, you can do that through the \"Work Settings\" page (there is a button on the page of the newly created work).","title":"Step-by-Step"},{"location":"guides/licenses/","text":"Choosing a License When uploading work to ScholarSphere, you should indicate any permissions for others to use and/or adapt the work - you do this by applying a license to the work. ScholarSphere offers several license options (and two non-license options) that can be applied to new uploads. From these options, it can be challenging to determine which is best for a particular scenario. To make the best choice, keep the following considerations in mind: Is the work under copyright in the United States? In the United States, copyright protects only \u201coriginal works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression.\u201d ( More on copyrightability ). If the work is not under copyright, you should choose the \u201c No Copyright \u201d option. This option is not a license, just a description of the copyright status of the work. Licenses are inappropriate for works not under copyright. If the work is under copyright, as is most often the case, there are additional considerations to bear in mind. Is the work covered under an agreement with a publisher? If the work is covered under a publishing agreement, then the agreement may limit your licensing options or prohibit sharing on ScholarSphere altogether. This is a particular important concern for open access versions of journal articles. For more on checking the terms of your publisher\u2019s agreement, see this FAQ . Is this a creative work or document (not software source code)? If the work is under copyright and it is a creative work (other than software software source code), then we recommend one of the Creative Commons licenses or the Creative Commons Public Domain Dedication. For more information about Creative Commons licenses, see the Creative Commons page from the Penn State Libraries and About CC Licenses from Creative Commons . Is the work a dataset? When considering licensing options for datasets, it\u2019s important to understand whether the dataset is copyrightable. Creative Commons licenses should not be applied to uncopyrightable material. Many datasets are uncopyrightable because they lack the creativity required by U.S. copyright law. A dataset can be copyrightable if its individual elements are copyrightable (this is the case with sets of photographs) or if the data is arranged creatively (conventional arrangements such as numeric or alphabetical order do not count). For more information, see the University of Michigan Library guide on Copyrightability . Although your data may not be copyrightable in the United States, leaving the work unlicensed may lead to uncertainty for future users, particularly those in other national jurisdictions. For this reason, we recommend the CC0 1.0 Public Domain Dedication (technically not a license) in cases where data authors wish to make their datasets accessible and reusable to the greatest extent possible. Does the work consist of software source code? ScholarSphere\u2019s licensing options include several popular open source licenses, such as the MIT License, BSD-3, and the GPLv3. The Open Source Initiative , provides helpful resources for selecting an appropriate open source license. Uploads without a license (In Copyright) If the work is under copyright, and you prefer or are required to share it without any license, then you may select \u201cIn Copyright (Rights Reserved)\u201d.

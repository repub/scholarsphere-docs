The content in ScholarSphere is open to the public and free for anyone to search and download. To deposit your work in ScholarSphere, you must be a Penn State faculty, student, or staff, with a current Web Access Account ID and password. Penn State emeriti faculty may also use ScholarSphere. Does it cost anything to upload to ScholarSphere? No, the University provides this service at no cost to current Penn State faculty, students, and staff and to emeriti faculty. What can I deposit to ScholarSphere? All types of scholarly materials, including publications, instructional materials, creative works, and research data can be deposited to ScholarSphere To be eligible for deposit in ScholarSphere, works must: Be produced or sponsored by at least one member of the Penn State community; Be of scholarly import, including publications, instructional materials, creative works, and research data produced in support of Penn State's teaching, learning, and research mission; and Meet the requirements of Penn State Policy AD69 Accessibility of Electronic and Information Technology . Information with a Sensitive Information Classification of Moderate (Level 2) or higher according to Penn State Policy AD95 Information Assurance and IT Security is not permitted in ScholarSphere. For more, see ScholarSphere\u2019s Content and Deposit Policy . Can I deposit my scholarly article in ScholarSphere? Whether you can deposit your scholarly article and which version you can deposit depend on the agreement you signed with your publisher prior to publication. The Sherpa Romeo database is a good starting point for figuring out your rights to deposit your article. You can search by journal or publisher name and see a summary of the journal's default rules related to \"self-archiving\" (the author's posting of the article online). Sherpa Romeo also provides links to the publisher's webpages about self-archiving, so you can double-check the summary to ensure it is up-to-date. If you have a copy of your publishing contract, it's also good to look at that. Your contract sets a minimum for what you can do. Many publishers have set policies giving authors additional rights to self-archive their articles. When looking at Sherpa Romeo, agreements, and publisher policies, pay close attention to two distinctions: the article version in question and the archiving or deposit location being described. Your rights to self-archive your work often vary depending on both of these. Timing is also important. For example, you might be allowed to post a post-print on your personal website from the time of acceptance but not be allowed to post a post-print on an institutional repository until 12 months after publication. For-profit article sharing sites, such as ResearchGate or Academia.edu, may be subject to longer embargoes or banned entirely. To modify the default terms of your publishing agreement before signing it, consider using an author's addendum . With questions, please contact the Office of Scholarly Communications and Copyright . Can I get a DOI (Digital Object Identifier) for my deposited work? Yes, you can assign a new DOI to your deposited work through the \u2018Work Settings\u201d page. You cannot assign a DOI to a draft work. How can I update or remove my work? In ScholarSphere, your work exists as a series of \u201cversions\u201d. You may update and delete the draft version of the work. Once a version is published, it cannot be modified or deleted . You can, however, create a new version that supersedes the previous version. Old versions remain accessible unless they are withdrawn or deleted by repository managers. If you need to withdraw or delete a work version, please contact us using the Contact Form . What happens to my files in ScholarSphere after I leave Penn State? The files remain in ScholarSphere and continue to be discoverable, accessible, and citable. If you have any questions or concerns about your files after you have left Penn State, you may submit them via our Contact Form . Are materials deposited to ScholarSphere kept forever? Deposited files and metadata are generally retained for the lifetime of the repository, however the guaranteed minimum preservation timeframe for work deposited to ScholarSphere is ten years. After that period, the Libraries may remove content that does not warrant continued preservation. For more, see ScholarSphere\u2019s Preservation Policy . Are there limits to how much I can deposit to ScholarSphere? There are no defined limits on file sizes, however uploading large files (larger than a few gigabytes) can be error prone, depending on your internet connection. Deposits larger than 100 GB in size require approval from repository managers in Penn State Libraries. This limit applies to the total size of files in a work or in a collection of related works by the same depositor. For more, see ScholarSphere\u2019s Content and Deposit Policy . To receive approval for depositing large datasets, contact us . How can I deposit very large datasets that are too large to upload through the web browser? We can arrange to receive large datasets using Globus . Contact us, and we will help you . What's the difference between ScholarSphere and cloud services like Dropbox? Reliability: ScholarSphere is a Penn State service that is fully funded and supported by the University Libraries and Information Technology Services. That is, the two most reputable organizations at Penn State responsible for knowledge management and information security and organization oversee the service and the infrastructure supporting it, to make persistently accessible the content that is deposited into ScholarSphere. Preservation: Our main focus is to preserve your scholarly work and make it accessible for the long term. Files deposited into ScholarSphere undergo audits and other digital preservation checks. This helps ensure that your scholarship will be available for generations to come. Dropbox and Box, on the other hand, are primarily file-sharing and file-storage services, rather than digital repository services implementing digital preservation best practices. Sharing scholarship for public access: ScholarSphere collects scholarly and scientific research outputs primarily for public access to them, largely in accordance with Open Access principles and in compliance with funding agency data management planning requirements. As commercial services focused mainly on file sharing and file storage, Dropbox and Box are open to a variety of content and not really intended for making content accessible and searchable via the web.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"faq/#frequently-asked-questions","text":"","title":"Frequently Asked Questions"},{"location":"faq/#who-can-use-scholarsphere","text":"The content in ScholarSphere is open to the public and free for anyone to search and download.

ScholarSphere Collections are well-suited to this purpose as they allow related works to be ordered, contextualized, and presented together. Instructions and recommendations for creating collections of student work on ScholarSphere are provided here. What to deposit on ScholarSphere? ScholarSphere is Penn State\u2019s institutional repository for research data and publications, maintained by the University Libraries. Its primary role is to help members of the Penn State community share their research publicly. Students are encouraged to deposit products of their research if: The work was supervised by Penn State faculty. The work is the student\u2019s (see IPG02 ) and they are willing to share it publicly. (Students are not encouraged to deposit work with the \u201cPenn State\u201d-only visibility setting. The work meets requirements defined in ScholarSphere\u2019s deposit policy . Anyone with a valid PSU account can deposit work to ScholarSphere, however repository managers may follow-up with additional questions and potentially remove deposits that do not meet these requirements. Creating Collections The general process for creating collections is, hopefully, fairly straight-forward. From the menu in the top-right corner of the ScholarSphere homepage, logged-in users can create collections using the \"Create New Collection\" form. Collections require a title and a description; additional metadata fields are recommended, especially publication date, keywords, and creators. The form for creating and editing collections includes a tab called \"works\" where you can search for works to add to the collection. It's important to note that you must have edit access for works to add them to a collection -- you must be listed as an \"editor\" on the work's \"Settings\" page. This means that if students have deposited their own works (i.e., following the \"self-deposit\" approach outlined below), they need to add you (the collection creator) as an editor for the work before it can be included in the collection. This is not necessary using the \"proxy deposit\" approach because the collection and constituent works are created by the same person. Two Approaches: Self-Deposit or Proxy Deposit There are two common approaches for creating collections of student work - they differ in who creates the works that will comprise the collection. In the self-deposit scenario, students deposit their own works (giving the collection creator edit access in the process). Alternatively, in the proxy deposit scenario, the collection creator deposits work on behalf of the students. In both scenarios, the collection creator adds work to the collection once the works are created. Self-Deposit The main advantage of the self-deposit approach is that it requires less work for the collection creator. In addition, when students deposit their own work, they agree to ScholarSphere's deposit agreement during the upload process--in the proxy deposit scenario, on the other hand, the collection creator must obtain permissions from students to upload works on their behalf (see below). Proxy Deposit The main advantage of the proxy deposit approach is that it tends to result in higher quality collections as librarians and instructors are more like to perform deposits in a complete and consistent manner. It also simplifies the permissions problem described above: students will not need to manually add the collection creator as an editor of their submissions. If past projects are any guide, the proxy deposit approach seems to be the preferred. This is likely because instructors and librarians prefer to shoulder the burden of many ScholarSphere submissions rather than guide students through that process or trust them to complete it correctly. Obtaining Permission from Students If collection creators prefer to deposit works on students' behalf, then they will need to obtain permissions from the students. A recommended approach is to include this permission, with a link to the deposit agreement, in a form used to collect work submissions from students (examples are available upon request). For example: \"I hereby approve my project files to be uploaded to ScholarSphere under the conditions above and accept the terms of the ScholarSphere deposit agreement (https://scholarsphere.psu.edu/agreement). Preferred Licenses In most cases, creative commons licenses are preferred for student work.

It is divided into four sections: Work Details : for entering basic information and metadata about the work, such as title, work type, and description Contributors : for setting author/creator information for the work Files : for uploading work files Review and Publish : for reviewing, setting a license, and finalizing the deposit The bar at the bottom of the page has several buttons: Save and Exit will save your work as a draft and direct you to the work's display page. Save and Continue will save your work as a draft and direct you to the next part of the form. Cancel will ignore any changes you may have made and direct to you to work's display page. Delete Draft will delete the draft version of the work. (This button only appears if you have already saved your work as a draft). About Work Versions ScholarSphere works consist of a series of versions. When you create a new work, an initial draft version is created, which can later be published . You cannot make changes to a version once it is published. To update a work with a published version, create and publish a new version for the work. The most recently published version of a work is the version that appears on the work's display page. At any point in the process of creating a new work, you can click the \"Save as Draft & Exit\" to save your progress. Your work will be saved as an unpublished draft. The following sections describe each part of the new work form. Work Details The work details sections is used to entering basic information and metadata about the work, such as title, work type, and description. Required fields are: Title : The work title as it should appear in search results or a bibliography. Work Type : such as Article, Book, Dataset, etc. Description : the work's abstract or short description. This field supports markdown formatting. Publication Date : the work's publication date can be specific to the year (2020), month (2020-11), or day (2020-11-22). Contributors The contributors form is for adding authorship or \"creator\" information for the work. Use the Add another creator field to search for collaborators using their name, PSU email, or ORCID ID . What is an ORCID ID? An ORCID ID is a unique, open digital identifier that distinguishes researchers with the same or similar names. If the author does not appear in the search results, select the last option in the dropdown list (\"Choose this option to create your own\") to add a new entry to the list of creators. (Creators entered this way are marked as \"unidentified\" because they are not linked to a specific PSU account or ORCID). You can change the order of creators in the list using the up an down arrows, or remove them using the red \"x\". The Display Name field is used to set how the name appears on the work's display page. Files The files section is for uploading the files for your work. You may upload one or more files using the upload tool on the page. If your work consists of many files (more than you would want to individually download) or if it is organized in a folder hierarchy that should be preserved, we recommend combining the files/folders in a compressed . zip , or .tar.gz file. Upload limits Deposits larger than 100 GB in size require approval from repository managers in Penn State Libraries. Review and Publish The review and publish form is for finalizing your submission for publication. After confirming information added in previous sections, there are three additional fields to complete before publishing: License : The license you select affects how your work can used by others. We encourage licenses that permit open access and reuse. For more, see Choosing a License . Access : ScholarSphere supports two access settings, Public (preferred) and Penn State Only . By choosing Penn State Only, files can only be accessed by users with a Penn State Access ID. Depositor Agreement : Check the box indicating that you have read and agree to the ScholarSphere deposit agreement. Assigning a DOI After deposit, you may assign a DOI to your submission. A Digital Object Identifier ( DOI is an alphanumeric string that uniquely identifies and facilitates citation of your work. When to create a DOI? We recommend minting DOIs for all submissions unless the material already has a DOI from another publisher or repository . If the work already has a DOI, include it in the \"Publisher Identifiers\" field on the Work Details form. To create a DOI for your submission: From the work's main page, click the \"Work Settings\" button. On the Work Settings page, click \"Create a DOI for this work\" Setting an Embargo If necessary, you may apply an embargo on your submission. An embargo will block access to deposited files until after the embargo date. To set an embargo date: From the work's main page, click the \"Work Settings\" button.

Whether you can deposit your scholarly article and which version you can deposit depend on the agreement you signed with your publisher prior to publication. The Sherpa Romeo database is a good starting point for figuring out your rights to deposit your article. You can search by journal or publisher name and see a summary of the journal's default rules related to \"self-archiving\" (the author's posting of the article online). Sherpa Romeo also provides links to the publisher's webpages about self-archiving, so you can double-check the summary to ensure it is up-to-date. If you have a copy of your publishing contract, it's also good to look at that. Your contract sets a minimum for what you can do. Many publishers have set policies giving authors additional rights to self-archive their articles. When looking at Sherpa Romeo, agreements, and publisher policies, pay close attention to two distinctions: the article version in question and the archiving or deposit location being described. Your rights to self-archive your work often vary depending on both of these. Timing is also important. For example, you might be allowed to post a post-print on your personal website from the time of acceptance but not be allowed to post a post-print on an institutional repository until 12 months after publication. For-profit article sharing sites, such as ResearchGate or Academia.edu, may be subject to longer embargoes or banned entirely. To modify the default terms of your publishing agreement before signing it, consider using an author's addendum. With questions, please contact the Office of Scholarly Communications and Copyright .

ScholarSphere offers several license options (and two non-license options) that can be applied to new uploads. From these options, it can be challenging to determine which is best for a particular scenario. To make the best choice, keep the following considerations in mind: Is the work under copyright in the United States? In the United States, copyright protects only \u201coriginal works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression.\u201d ( More on copyrightability ). If the work is not under copyright, you should choose the \u201c No Copyright \u201d option. This option is not a license, just a description of the copyright status of the work. Licenses are inappropriate for works not under copyright. If the work is under copyright, as is most often the case, there are additional considerations to bear in mind. Is the work covered under an agreement with a publisher? If the work is covered under a publishing agreement, then the agreement may limit your licensing options or prohibit sharing on ScholarSphere altogether. This is a particular important concern for open access versions of journal articles. For more on checking the terms of your publisher\u2019s agreement, see this FAQ . Is this a creative work or document (not software source code)? If the work is under copyright and it is a creative work (other than software software source code), then we recommend one of the Creative Commons licenses or the Creative Commons Public Domain Dedication. For more information about Creative Commons licenses, see the Creative Commons page from the Penn State Libraries and About CC Licenses from Creative Commons . Is the work a dataset? When considering licensing options for datasets, it\u2019s important to understand whether the dataset is copyrightable. Creative Commons licenses should not be applied to uncopyrightable material. Many datasets are uncopyrightable because they lack the creativity required by U.S. copyright law. A dataset can be copyrightable if its individual elements are copyrightable (this is the case with sets of photographs) or if the data is arranged creatively (conventional arrangements such as numeric or alphabetical order do not count). For more information, see the University of Michigan Library guide on Copyrightability . Although your data may not be copyrightable in the United States, leaving the work unlicensed may lead to uncertainty for future users, particularly those in other national jurisdictions. For this reason, we recommend the CC0 1.0 Public Domain Dedication (technically not a license) in cases where data authors wish to make their datasets accessible and reusable to the greatest extent possible. Does the work consist of software source code? ScholarSphere\u2019s licensing options include several popular open source licenses, such as the MIT License, BSD-3, and the GPLv3. The Open Source Initiative , provides helpful resources for selecting an appropriate open source license. Uploads without a license (In Copyright) If the work is under copyright, and you prefer or are required to share it without any license, then you may select \u201cIn Copyright (Rights Reserved)\u201d.
